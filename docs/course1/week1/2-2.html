# 2.2: Supervised Learning With Neural Networks


- Neural networks are super hyped, and they've mainly used for supervised Learning

## What is supervised learning?

- A problem where you're given some features $x$ and we predict some output $y$.

- Some examples of where NNs have been used:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Input</th>
        <th>Output</th>
        <th>Application</th>
        <th>Neural Network Type/Arch</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>home features</td>
        <td>price</td>
        <td>real estate</td>
        <td>standard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ad,user info</td>
        <td>click on ad? (binary)</td>
        <td>online ads</td>
        <td>standard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>image</td>
        <td>object (1-1000)</td>
        <td>photo tagging, computer vision</td>
        <td>CNN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>audio</td>
        <td>text transcript</td>
        <td>speech recognition</td>
        <td>RNN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>english</td>
        <td>chinese</td>
        <td>machine translation</td>
        <td>RNN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>image, LIDAR info</td>
        <td>position of other cars</td>
        <td>self-driving cars</td>
        <td>custom/complex</td>
    </tr>
</table>

- Different types of NNs are used for different applications, as seen above.
- Visualization of the different types:

## Structured vs. Unstructured Data
- Structured data = data in a database
  - Each feature has a very well defined meaning

- Unstructured data = things like audio, images, and text
  - Not all of the pixels/audio/text has a well-defined meaning!
  - Typically hard for computers to understand, but new advances make them really good
  - NNs processing this are more glamorous and are heard about in the media a lot
