# 2.1 What is a neural network?

- Deep learning = training Neural Networks

## Guiding Example: Housing Price Prediction

- Given the size of a house, predict the price
- You might fit a function like this:

- Turns out this is actually a simple NN (the simplest possible one, actually):

```
                  +---------+
                  |         |
Size (x)+-------> | neuron  +-------> Price (y)
                  |         |
                  +---------+

```

- The function in the image above is called the ReLU function (Rectified Linear Unit)


### More Complex Example: Multiple Features

- Include more data than just size:

- Let's call the features `size, bedrooms, zipcode, wealth` $x$, where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (where $n$ is the number of features)
- Let's call the price `y`


- The beauty of a Neural Network is that you only give it `x` and `y` and it does everything else in the middle


#### More Formal Definition

$x_1$ is size, $x_2$ is #bedrooms, $x_3$ is the ZIP code, and $x_4$ is the "wealth" of an area.
The goal is to predict the price $y$.

The first layer is called the *input layer*, where the data comes in.
The second layer is a *hidden layer*. Every node in the input layer is connected to every node in the hidden layer, making it *densely-connected*.

## Review

- Neural networks work really well in *supervised-learning* problems, where you're given some inputs $x$ and outputs $y$.
