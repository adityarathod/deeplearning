# O.1 (Optional) Heroes of Deep Learning: Geoffrey Hinton Interview

1. Many people know you as a legend, the "Godfather" of deep learning. How did you get involved way back then?
- In high school, Hinton had a friend who was talking about how the brain works, piqued his curiosity
- Did physiology and physics, but then switched to philosophy, and then to psychology
  - Thought that all of that was insufficient to explain how the brain worked
- Took some time off, became carpenter, but came back to do AI in Edinburgh
  - Studied w/ Langer Higgins, who did some work on NNs but largely gave up
  - Got a PhD in Ai
- Went to CA on a Sloan fellowship, in CA people were actually interested in NNs
  - UCSD, 1982: Rumelhart, Williams, and Hinton wrote a backprop paper, it wasn't new, but their paper gained traction

2. Why do you think your paper helped the community latch onto backprop?
- They managed to get into *Nature*
  - Background: They impressed one of the reviewers with something like Word2Vec
