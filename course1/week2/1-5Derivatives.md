# 1.5: Derivatives

## Intuition About Derivatives
- Let's say we have a function $f(a) = 3a$.

- Take the value $a = 2$. $f(2) = 6$.
  - Let's nudge $a$ a bit, to $2.001$. $f(2.001) = 6.003$.
    - So the derivative (slope) at $a=2$ is $3$.
      - Also written as $\frac{df(a)}{da} = \frac{d}{da}f(a)=3$.

- So a derivative at a point is basically the slope of the point and a small (infinitesimal) nudge.
  - Linear functions have a constant derivative at every point
